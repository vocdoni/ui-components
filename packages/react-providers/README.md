# @vocdoni/react-providers

This package includes react context & providers for integration with the Vocdoni protocol via the [Vocdoni SDK](https://developer.vocdoni.io/sdk).


The best place to learn about using this package is the [developer portal](https://developer.vocdoni.io/ui-components).

## Getting Started


Using your favorite package manager:

~~~bash
yarn add @vocdoni/react-providers
~~~

The very first step is to add the `<ClientProvider />` as a wrapper of your application or, at least, of your election:

~~~tsx
import { ClientProvider } from '@vocdoni/react-providers'

const App = () => {
  const signer = /* any ethers based signer */
  return (
    <ClientProvider env='stg' signer={signer}>
      {/* your actual app code */}
    </ClientProvider>
  )
}
~~~

`ClientProvider` is a dependency of the other providers, so you'll have to ensure you initialize it first as the parent.

## Reference

The developer portal includes a [reference](https://developer.vocdoni.io/ui-components) for using the `@vocdoni/react-providers` package.

## Examples

You can find mock-functional usage of the react providers in the ui-components [documentation](https://developer.vocdoni.io/ui-components/Election). There is also real-world usage of many of the providers from this package in the [code](https://github.com/vocdoni/ui-scaffold) for the Vocdoni application front-end.

## Preview

In addition to the live examples in the documentation, you can see this code in use at https://app.vocdoni.io/

## Disclaimer

This project is a WIP and is subject to continuous changes during its
development. We encourage you to review this repository and the developer portal for any changes.

## Contributing

While we welcome contributions from the community, we do not track all of our issues on Github and we may not have the resources to onboard developers and review complex pull requests. That being said, there are multiple ways you can get involved with the project.

Please review our [development guidelines](https://developer.vocdoni.io/development-guidelines).
