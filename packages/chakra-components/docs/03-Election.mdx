## Election provider

To use election components you have to wrap them using the `ElectionProvider`

```jsx
<ElectionProvider id='your-organization-uid'>
  <ElectionHeader />
  <ElectionTitle />
  <ElectionSchedule textTransform='uppercase' />
  <ElectionStatusBadge variant='solid' colorScheme='teal' />
  <ElectionDescription fontFamily='monospace' />
  <ElectionQuestions />
</ElectionProvider>
```

## Election Header

Show election header image.

```jsx live
<ElectionHeader fallbackSrc={'img/logo-dark.png'} />
```

`fallbackSrc` is a chakra prop to get a fallback in case of error. In the case of the `<ElectionHeader />` component
it will also be used in case no header image is defined in the current election.

`ElectionHeader` extends chakra's [`Image` component](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/image).

## Election Title

Show election title.

```jsx live
<ElectionTitle />
```

## Election Schedule

Show election period. You can specify date format using [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/v2.30.0/docs/format) format

```jsx live
<ElectionSchedule format={'d-L-y HH:mm'} />
```

## Election Status Badge

It shows election status badge. Possible values of the election are defined on `ElectionStatus` from [`@vocdoni/sdk`](https://github.com/vocdoni/vocdoni-sdk/blob/c1c6fee380c646020db7c0934900296a92309670/src/types/election/published.ts#L6-L18):
`PROCESS_UNKNOWN`, `UPCOMING`, `ONGOING`, `ENDED`, `CANCELED`, `PAUSED`, `RESULTS`.

```jsx live
<ElectionStatusBadge variant='solid' colorScheme='teal' />
```

To style the [`ElectionStatusBadge`](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/tag) leverage the capabilities of the Chakra
styled system. By simply adjusting the `colorScheme` property based on the election status will enable you to easily alter the
color of the badge. This approach mirrors the one employed by the
[default color scheme](https://github.com/vocdoni/ui-components/blob/2ca7942/packages/chakra-components/src/components/Election/StatusBadge.tsx#L12-L24)
included on the Vocdoni Chakra Components.

## Election Description

Show election description.

```jsx live
<ElectionDescription fontFamily='monospace' />
```

:::info

This component renderers **Markdown** text.

:::

## Election Questions

Show election questions.

```jsx live
<ElectionQuestions />
```

Questions have some preconfigured behaviors you should be aware of:

- When census strategy is any oauth type or spreadsheet, a confirm modal is shown before sending a vote. You can
  customize both the contents and the theme of this modal.
- A basic validation is configured in the questions form (no empty questions mainly). There's a method invoked when
  there are errors in the questions form.

```jsx live
<ElectionQuestions
  onInvalid={(errors) => console.error(errors)}
  confirmContents={(questions, answers) => (
    <>
      <p>Customizing contents is quite easy</p>
      <QuestionsConfirmation questions={questions} answers={values} />
    </>
  )}
/>
```

The `<QuestionsConfirmation />` component is the default one used, but you can overwrite that with your own components.

:::info

This component renders **Markdown** text in the question descriptions.

:::

## Election Results

Show election results.

```jsx live
<ElectionResults />
```

# Internal components

There are some internal components that are not exported but can still be styled.
Some of these are:

- `ConfirmModal`
- `QuestionsConfirmation`
