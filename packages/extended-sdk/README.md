# @vocdoni/extended-sdk

This package is an extension of the Vocdoni SDK client that implements some functions that are not included on the
original SDK. These functions are related to Vochain statistics, blocks, transactions etc... Which are not intended to be
used for common users.

To use it add the custom client on the provider like this:

```tsx
import { ExtendedSDKClient } from '@vocdoni/extended-sdk';
import { ClientProvider } from '@vocdoni/chakra-components';

const VocdoniSdkProvider = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => {
  const environment = VOCDONI_ENVIRONMENT as EnvOptions;

  const sdkClient = new ExtendedSDKClient({
    env: environment,
  });

  return (
      <ClientProvider client={sdkClient}>
        {children}
      </ClientProvider>
  );
};
```

And then, at places you want to use it, specify the client type like:

```tsx
const { client } = useClient<ExtendedSDKClient>();
```
