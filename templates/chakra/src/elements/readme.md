What are elements?
==================

Elements are components used by react-router, meaning they have specific
dependencies and can only be executed as react-router route elements.

Some, like `Vote.tsx` receive  dependencies using hooks like `useLoaderData`.
Others, like `App.tsx`, use specific react-router calls like `useNavigate`.
