# ui-components

This repository aims to ease the creation of voting interfaces for user-facing applications. The purpose is to allow developers to easily integrate a variety of voting flow components and style these components as desired.

## Included Packages

| Component | Description |
| ---: | --- |
| [![chakra-components badge]][`@vocdoni/chakra-components`] | Voting-related react components built with chakra for easy integration with Vocdoni. |
| [![rainbowkit-wallets badge]][`@vocdoni/rainbowkit-wallets`] | A set of custom wallets for rainbowkit. |
| [![react-providers badge]][`@vocdoni/react-providers`] | React providers and hooks, where most of the Vocdoni protocol integration happens (required by `@vocdoni/chakra-components`) |
| [![extended-sdk badge]][`@vocdoni/extended-sdk`] | Package extending our SDK functionalities (for advanced usage). |

The best place to learn about using ui-components packages is the [developer portal](https://developer.vocdoni.io/ui-components).

## Getting Started

Each of these packages can be used in a typescript/javascript project by importing them, eg. `yarn add @vocdoni/chakra-components`. Follow the developer documentation, or go to each individual package's readme file, for further details.

Each of the packages has a typescript file configured as an entrypoint, so you should be able to just run `yarn dev` on the included chakra template to start developing any of the included packages.

If you link (via npm/yarn link) any of the included packages to your project, your project MUST be able to run typescript code. Otherwise it will fail.

Turbo was initially configured for the development process, but its usage is minimal; still, you can use it for some global commands:

- `yarn build`: will build every package in the monorepo (including templates)
- `yarn clean`: removes `dist`, `.turbo` and `node_modules` folders in the
  entire monorepo.
- `yarn lint`: runs the linter of each package (may vary per package, but
  usually prettier & tsc).
- `yarn test`: runs all the tests in the monorepo. Note these are configured globally in the monorepo (testing dependencies are in the base `package.json` file)

## Reference

The developer portal includes a [reference](https://developer.vocdoni.io/ui-components) for the `@vocdoni/chakra-components` package that also incorporates the full functionality of `@vocdoni/react-providers`.

## Examples

You can find mock-functional examples of each of the chakra components in the ui-components [documentation](https://developer.vocdoni.io/ui-components/Election). There is also real-world usage of many of the components and providers from this library in the [code](https://github.com/vocdoni/ui-scaffold) for the Vocdoni application front-end.

## Preview

In addition to the live examples in the documentation, you can see many of the components in use at https://app.vocdoni.io/

## Disclaimer

This project is a WIP and is subject to continuous changes during its
development. We encourage you to review this repository and the developer portal for any changes.
